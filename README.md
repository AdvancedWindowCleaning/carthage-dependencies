# Carthage Specifications

This repo exists to support frameworks that do not offer [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) support. By hosting a JSON file that provides a mapping between the versions and the matching urls of the framework, we can include the raw framework in the project. Besides that, all we have to do is to refer to the JSON url in the Cartfile.
